libgrin is a golang Grin library for building [Grin](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin) applications.
Currently, it contains the basic consensus parameters, chain, slate structures and proof of work verification code.

The `client` package contains wrappers around the Grin node API and the wallet owner API using libgrin.
